------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Before we lay out the stack, we need to know something about the
-- liveness of the stack slots. In particular, to decide whether we can
-- reuse a stack location to hold multiple stack slots, we need to know
-- when each of the stack slots is used.
-- Although tempted to use something simpler, we really need a full interference
-- graph. Consider the following case:
--   case <...> of
--     1 -> <spill x>; // y is dead out
--     2 -> <spill y>; // x is dead out
--     3 -> <spill x and y>
-- If we consider the arms in order and we use just the deadness information given by a
-- dataflow analysis, we might decide to allocate the stack slots for x and y
-- to the same stack location, which will lead to incorrect code in the third arm.
-- We won't make this mistake with an interference graph.

-- First, the liveness analysis.
-- We represent a slot with an area, an offset into the area, and a width.
-- Tracking the live slots is a bit tricky because there may be loads and stores
-- into only a part of a stack slot (e.g. loading the low word of a 2-word long),
-- e.g. Slot A 0 8 overlaps with Slot A 4 4.
--
-- The definition of a slot set is intended to reduce the number of overlap
-- checks we have to make. There's no reason to check for overlap between
-- slots in different areas, so we segregate the map by Area's.
-- We expect few slots in each Area, so we collect them in an unordered list.
-- To keep these lists short, any contiguous live slots are coalesced into
-- a single slot, on insertion.

-- Compute liveness, build the interference graph, and allocate slots for the areas.
-- We visit each basic block in a (generally) forward order.

-- At each instruction that names a register subarea r, we immediately allocate
-- any available slot on the stack by the following procedure:
--  1. Find the sub-areas S that conflict with r
--  2. Find the stack slots used for S
--  3. Choose a contiguous stack space s not in S (s must be large enough to hold r)

-- For a CallArea, we allocate the stack space only when we reach a function
-- call that returns to the CallArea's blockId.
-- Then, we allocate the Area subject to the following constraints:
--   a) It must be younger than all the sub-areas that are live on entry to the block
--         This constraint is only necessary for the successor of a call
--   b) It must not overlap with any already-allocated Area with which it conflicts
--   	   (ie at some point, not necessarily now, is live at the same time)

-- at proc points. Otherwise, the stack pointer can point anywhere.

{- Note [Procpoint Sp offset]

The calculation of inSp is a little tricky.  (Un)fortunately, if you get
it wrong, you will get inefficient but correct code.  You know you've
got it wrong if the generated stack pointer bounces up and down for no
good reason.

Why can't we just set inSp to the location of the slot?  (This is what
the code used to do.)  The trouble is when we actually hit the proc
point the start of the slot will not be the same as the actual Sp due
to argument passing:

  a:
      I32[(young<b> + 4)] = cde;
      // Stack pointer is moved to young end (bottom) of young<b> for call
      // +-------+
      // | arg 1 |
      // +-------+ <- Sp
      call (I32[foobar::I32])(...) returns to Just b (4) (4) with update frame 4;
  b:
      // After call, stack pointer is above the old end (top) of
      // young<b> (the difference is spOffset)
      // +-------+ <- Sp
      // | arg 1 |
      // +-------+

If we blithely set the Sp to be the same as the slot (the young end of
young<b>), an adjustment will be necessary when we go to the next block.
This is wasteful.  So, instead, for the next block after a procpoint,
the actual Sp should be set to the same as the true Sp when we just
entered the procpoint.  Then manifestSP will automatically do the right
thing.

Questions you may ask:

1. Why don't we need to change the mapping for the procpoint itself?
   Because manifestSP does its own calculation of the true stack value,
   manifestSP will notice the discrepancy between the actual stack
   pointer and the slot start, and adjust all of its memory accesses
   accordingly.  So the only problem is when we adjust the Sp in
   preparation for the successor block; that's why this code is here and
   not in setSuccSPs.

2. Why don't we make the procpoint call area and the true offset match
   up?  If we did that, we would never use memory above the true value
   of the stack pointer, thus wasting all of the stack we used to store
   arguments.  You might think that some clever changes to the slot
   offsets, using negative offsets, might fix it, but this does not make
   semantic sense.

3. If manifestSP is already calculating the true stack value, why we can't
   do this trick inside manifestSP itself?  The reason is that if two
   branches join with inconsistent SPs, one of them has to be fixed: we
   can't know what the fix should be without already knowing what the
   chosen location of SP is on the next successor.  (This is
   the "succ already knows incoming SP" case), This calculation cannot
   be easily done in manifestSP, since it processes the nodes
   /backwards/.  So we need to have figured this out before we hit
   manifestSP.

-- After determining the stack layout, we can:
-- 1. Replace references to stack Areas with addresses relative to the stack

-- 2. Insert adjustments to the stack pointer to ensure that it is at a
--    conventional location at each proc point.
--    Because we don't take interrupts on the execution stack, we only need the
--    stack pointer to be younger than the live values on the stack at proc points.
-- 3. Compute the maximum stack offset used in the procedure and replace
--    the stack high-water mark with that offset.
