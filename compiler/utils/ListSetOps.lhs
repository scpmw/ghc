@mkLookupFun eq alist@ is a function which looks up
its argument in the association list @alist@, returning a Maybe type.
@mkLookupFunDef@ is similar except that it is given a value to return
on failure.

\begin{code}
mkLookupFun :: (key -> key -> Bool)     -- Equality predicate
            -> [(key,val)]              -- The assoc list
            -> key                      -- The key
            -> Maybe val                -- The corresponding value

mkLookupFun eq alist s
  = case [a | (s',a) <- alist, s' `eq` s] of
      []    -> Nothing
      (a:_) -> Just a

findInList :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Maybe a
findInList _ [] = Nothing
findInList p (x:xs) | p x       = Just x
                    | otherwise = findInList p xs

The first cases in @equivClasses@ above are just to cut to the point
more quickly...

@runs@ groups a list into a list of lists, each sublist being a run of
identical elements of the input list. It is passed a predicate @p@ which
tells when two elements are equal.

\begin{code}
runs :: (a -> a -> Bool) -- Equality
     -> [a]
     -> [[a]]

runs _ []     = []

                        -- each group appears in the first result

    collect_dups dups_so_far [x]        = (dups_so_far,      x)

findDupsEq eq (x:xs) | null eq_xs  = findDupsEq eq xs
                     | otherwise   = (x:eq_xs) : findDupsEq eq neq_xs
    where (eq_xs, neq_xs) = partition (eq x) xs

removeRedundant :: (a -> a -> Bool)   -- True <=> discard the *second* argument
                -> [a] -> [a]
-- Remove any element y for which 
--     another element x is in the list
-- and (x `subsumes` y)
-- Preserves order
removeRedundant subsumes xs

\end{code}


\begin{code}
equivClassesByUniq :: (a -> Unique) -> [a] -> [[a]]
        -- NB: it's *very* important that if we have the input list [a,b,c],
        -- where a,b,c all have the same unique, then we get back the list
        --      [a,b,c]
        -- not
        --      [c,b,a]
        -- Hence the use of foldr, plus the reversed-args tack_on below
equivClassesByUniq get_uniq xs
  = eltsUFM (foldr add emptyUFM xs)
  where
    add a ufm = addToUFM_C tack_on ufm (get_uniq a) [a]
    tack_on old new = new++old
