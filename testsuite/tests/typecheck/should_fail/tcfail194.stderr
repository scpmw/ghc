    Couldn't match type ‘[a0]’ with ‘a -> t’
    Expected type: (a -> t) -> [a] -> [a]
      Actual type: [a0] -> [a0]
    Relevant bindings include z :: [t] (bound at tcfail194.hs:9:1)
    Possible cause: ‘take’ is applied to too many arguments
    In the expression: take 5
    In a stmt of a list comprehension: then take 5 by x
