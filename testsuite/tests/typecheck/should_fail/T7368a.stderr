    Couldn't match type ‘f’ with ‘Bad’
      ‘f’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for fun :: f (Bad f) -> Bool at T7368a.hs:7:15
    Expected type: f (Bad f)
      Actual type: Bad t0
    Relevant bindings include
      fun :: f (Bad f) -> Bool (bound at T7368a.hs:8:1)
    In the pattern: Bad x
    In an equation for ‘fun’: fun (Bad x) = True
